This is a Drupal 8 module built for Information Technology Outreach Services at UGA.

This module scans the entire site for links through a custom form and checks them to see if they are valid.

It searches through all of the different content types as well as media and taxonomy for links.

It then checks each link to see if it is valid and stores its data in the site database.

It prints the link information into a custom table that allows you to easily manage and change the broken links.

The module also allows for easy export of the table to CSV.
